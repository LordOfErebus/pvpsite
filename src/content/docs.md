Hello and Welcome to PvPCraft's documentation. Some features that are still being tested may not be documented.

Prefixes default to /, // and !! but can be changed in your servers settings page.

This documentation is primarily about text commands.

## Permissions

Permissions are the cornerstone of every system of **PvPCraft** they allow you to limit commands to a specific channel,
group or user in whatever way you deem fit.

If you are familiar with linux commands this chart should be enough. Just remember more specific things enhiret from less specific things.

| command  | description  | node  |
