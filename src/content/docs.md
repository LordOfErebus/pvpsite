Hello and Welcome to PvPCraft's documentation. Some features that are still being tested may not be documented.

Prefixes default to /, // and !! but can be changed in your servers settings page.

This documentation is primarily about text commands.

## Permissions

Permissions are the cornerstone of every system of **PvPCraft** they allow you to limit commands to a specific channel,
group or user in whatever way you deem fit.

| command  | description  | node  |
|---|---|---|
|   |   |   |
